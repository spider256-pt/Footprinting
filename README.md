## 📌 What is Footprinting?

> Footprinting is the first and most crucial phase of ethical hacking. It involves collecting as much information as possible about the target system or organization to identify potential attack vectors.

## 🎯 Objectives of Footprinting:
- Discover publicly available data about the target
- Identify domain, IP ranges, DNS information
- Gather employee, contact, and metadata information
- Build a profile of the target before active engagement
